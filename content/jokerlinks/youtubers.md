This is a list of YouTubers that I enjoy watching, both technical and non-technical. This is not a comprehensive list, as my subscription list is around 300 channels long. Also this list is subject to change...youtube is a messy website filled with messy people. Controversies happen, and people are outed as terrible. May add or remove them as needed.

# technology youtubers

[Lazy Game Reviews](https://www.youtube.com/@lgr) - Retro tech and retro games! He doesn't do games that much these days, but he still reviews plenty of old tech. Interesting to see how things evolve over time!

[Upper Echelon Gamers](https://www.youtube.com/@UpperEchelon) - Privacy youtuber. Looks into the privacy violations that companies and governments commit, and ways to maintain your privacy if you care enough to do something about it.

[The Hated One](https://www.youtube.com/@TheHatedOne) - Another privacy YouTuber, but he looks into the economics of the ultra-rich and some of the corruption in the modern world of finance. I highly recommend it! Good deep-dive journalism.

[Mental Outlaw](https://www.youtube.com/@MentalOutlaw) - A lot less edgy than Upper Echelon or Hated One, but he covers a lot of news related to cybersecurity and tech trends. He is fantastic for keeping up with tech news!

[Louis Rossman](https://www.youtube.com/@rossmanngroup) - Man yells at cloud, is entertaining and informative.

[Jack Rhysider](https://www.youtube.com/@JackRhysider) - Darknet Diaries podcast. Covers a lot of high-profile cybersecurity incidents, and how the bad guys were thwarted, or what should have been done to thwart them.

[SomeordinaryGamers](https://www.youtube.com/@SomeOrdinaryGamers) - this guy does tech videos, and virus investigations. He also does youtube drama sometimes, but I don't care about that nearly as much as the tech stuff.

# entertainment

[Civvie 11](https://www.youtube.com/@Civvie11) - This guy discusses old PC games such as *Quake, Doom, Blood, Duke Nukem,* and more. He also covers new games that are made in the style of old ones, such as *Warhammer 40k: Boltgun* or *Dusk*

[Glitch](https://www.youtube.com/@GLITCH) - Distributor of Indie Animation. I love these guys because they fund some really ambitious projects that break the mold in animation.


[Dust](https://www.youtube.com/@watchdust) - Movie-quality sci-fi short films. I am constantly in awe of what indie filmmakers will do on a shoestring budget, and this channel showcases some of the brightest undiscovered filmmakers of our era.

[Pony Smashe](https://www.youtube.com/@ponysmasher) - This is the guy that made *Lights Out*, and 2 DC superhero movies called *Shazam*. When he isn't making big-budget films, he makes films on a shoestring budget in his house. Its wonderful stuff! His small films are unironically better than his big budget films, and I am ecstatic that he continues to make them despite having "made it in Hollywood."

[Second Wind](https://www.youtube.com/@SecondWindGroup) - New home for *The Escapist* personalities. Ok, so, this is a weird one. *The Escapist* was a huge channel that focused on game retrospectives, reviews, and discussion. Their most popular personality was Yahtzee Crowshaw, showrunner of *Zero Punctuation.* They got bought out, their team lead got fired without notice, everyone quit in protest. Now *Second Wind* is basically The Escapist but slightly different to avoid copyright issues with their previous employer. Its high quality stuff, and I like to recommend them,

[Townsends](https://www.youtube.com/@townsends) - 18th century historical reenactor. Shares what life was like during the founding of America, and what foods they made. I can't get enough of this guy...his channel is peak comfy material.


# scaretubers

Ok, an explanation. Scaretubers are youtubers that discuss distrubing cases, unsolved mysteries, and paranormal events. There isn't really a good word for them, so I call them scaretubers because their content is inherently creepy. 

This genre is extremely NSFW, as the topics can be anywhere from something silly like mothman sightings, to dark things such as serial killers, cults, or worse. Most of them have good journalistic practices, so I like to recommend them to people I know that won't be too disturbed, but its dark stuff. Viewer discretion is highly advised.

[Nexpo](https://www.youtube.com/@Nexpo) - Covers accidents, disasters, and lost media. 

[Barely Sociable](https://www.youtube.com/@BarelySociable) - covers unsolved mysteries, and conspiracy theories
 
[Wendigoon](https://www.youtube.com/@Wendigoon) - Covers dark media, urban legends, conspiracy theories, and when he isn't covering dark things he talks about theology.

[Blind Dweller](https://www.youtube.com/@ShroudedHand) - Covers serial killers, criminals, and disturbing fringe groups.

[Blame It On Jorge](https://www.youtube.com/@blameitonjorge) - Covers cults, and lost media.

[Okis Weird Stories](https://www.youtube.com/@okisweirdstories) - Covers cults, fraud, and disproves conspiracy theories
