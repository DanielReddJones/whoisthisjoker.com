title: Fun And Games

This is a non-comprehensive list of games and demos that I have found on sites like HackerNews and Discord. It will be updated periodically, so feel free to check back occasionally. If any websites are broken, let me know and I will fix/remove the link.


[Slow Roads](https://slowroads.io/) - If you want the feeling of endlessly driving, but you don't want to leave your chair, this is a fun time waster.

[NightDrive](https://incoherency.co.uk/nightdrive/) - This demo makes you feel like a kid on a late night road trip. Few better feelings.

[excel 97 Easter Egg](https://rezmason.github.io/excel_97_egg/?o=src&l=63,1) - This demo is a recreation/port of the Excel 97 Easter egg that let you freely explore this randomly generated world and view the credits of the people who worked on it. [The guy that made this](https://www.rezmason.net/projects.html) also made some other cool demos, but I liked this one the best.

[Sandtrix](https://mslivo.itch.io/sandtrix) - Its Tetris, but with sand. It's pretty cool. Check it out.

[Ancient Map of Fairy Land](https://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~284920~90057677:An-Ancient-Mappe-of-Fairyland;JSESSIONID=c16e8e27-d9e1-426b-b0a8-98446719f24c?qvq=q%3Amappe%20of%20fairyland%3Bsort%3Apub_list_no_initialsort%2Cpub_date%2Cpub_list_no%2Cseries_no%3Blc%3ARUMSEY%7E8%7E1&sort=pub_list_no_initialsort%2Cpub_date%2Cpub_list_no%2Cseries_no&mi=0&trs=3) - 
This is neither a game nor a demo, but a picture. It is an extremely large and detailed fantasy map that I could look at for hours. Made in 1918 and designed by Bernard Sleigh. DavidRumsey.com as a whole is a pretty neat map archive site that I want more people to know about.

[Open source Game Clones](https://osgameclones.com/) - Want gaming but hate "absolutely proprietary?" osgameclones is a pretty long list of games that have been open sourced, along with download links and repos.

[POOM](https://freds72.itch.io/poom) - This game is a version of DOOM for the PICO-8 fantasy console. Its impressive, given the limitations of the PICO-8. The levels are not the same, but it is a good time all around

[Squishy Earth](www.byronknoll.com/earth.html) - By Byron Knoll. Its a squishy earth. Have fun!
