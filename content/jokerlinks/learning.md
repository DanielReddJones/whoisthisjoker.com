This page showcases some interesting learning resources I have found over the internet. I have not gone through every single one, but I do sometimes watch/read them in my downtime to expand my skills.

[TryHackMe.com](https://tryhackme.com/) - This is a great website for learning cyber-security. I like logging into this pretty often and taking some of their courses. If you have downtime at work this is also a great site, because the virtual machines are hosted in-browser on a private network. It's perfect for killing a few minutes of free time a day.

[Open Source CS Degree](https://github.com/ForrestKnight/open-source-cs) - While I have not enrolled in these because I already have a CS degree, this list is invaluable for those who want to learn computer science but can't/don't want to go to university. Now, you aren't going to actually get a degree with this. But knowledge is knowledge, and knowledge is power.

[The little book about OS development](https://littleosbook.github.io/) - This gives me a headache just looking at it. Still, a great resource if making a hobby OS is one of your goals. [osdev.org](https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page) is also a fantastic resource if you are insane enough to want to try doing this.

[Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) - Free public domain ebooks

[LibriVox](https://librivox.org/) - Free Public Domain Audiobooks

[Low Level Learning](https://www.youtube.com/@LowLevelLearning) - This is a fantastic YouTube channel for learning how low level C and Assembly works.
