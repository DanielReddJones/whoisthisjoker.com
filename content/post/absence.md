So, it has been a LONG time since I posted here. And, believe me, there is a reason. For the most part, I got too busy spending time with family, so programming instead of spending time with loved ones was not appropriate. For January, the reason was because my mother passed away. Early in the morning on January 5th 2023, I was programming. I got a call from my brother, which was weird because he normally doesn't get up as early as I do. 



I learned that my mother, who we had just spent the holidays with and celebrated her 53rd birthday with on the 10th of December, had a stroke. Originally, the doctors said that she was going to make it, but that she was going to be different. While this is awful, I was hoping that she would pull through and I would get my mother back. On the 7th, I learned that was not happening. At 7 AM January 8th, she passed on her own.



I am currently in grieving. I am going to try and get back on the ball and start programming again, but I don't know how frequent I will be. The most shocking thing is that she was so young, and ate healthy. She ate primarily vegetables, and very little meat. She was diabetic, but switched to a low calorie/low sugar diet because she wanted to mitigate the effects. I don't know a lot about diabetes. I am a programmer, not a doctor or dietitian. Still, it came as an absolute shock and I am feeling miserable right now.



The rest of the family is taking it pretty hard as well. Besides the now-private Velma post I made back in October, and my brief also-privated existential crisis post, I want to keep personal feelings off of this website. I want this site to be a place for my projects. Still, I felt I should post about what has been happening since it has been so long. The funeral is over, and the memorial service was last week. It doesn't make it better, but now I feel that I should move forward. I am going to go through the <a href="https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/">Build Your Own Text Editor</a> course and update you as I go through it.



It feels wrong to just get back to work on these things, but it has been a very long time. I can't just shut down because she is no longer with me. Honestly, I don't know what I want to do and programming is the only thing that comes to mind. Will post next week.
