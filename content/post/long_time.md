# long time no update

It has been quite a while since I last posted, though there are good reasons. I am no longer working at LeTourneau University. I felt very conflicted about this back in november when I left, but I am enjoying my new position as a Systems Analyst at The Fikes Companies. I am currently working from home and assisting The Fikes companies with their merger with Caseys. Due to confidentiality I cannot talk much about it, but I am enjoying the work regardless.

As for my personal work, I am rewriting Bibliofile. I accidentally lost all the source code when I deleted my private git server. I got tired of maintaining it and paying for the priviledge, so I decided I was going to move it over to Github. Well, I downloaded the source code and deleted the server. However, now I cannot find the source code anywhere on my computer. After an hour of searching I realized either I misremembered downloading it, or the file got removed for some reason. While I am frustrated with this turn of events, it won't be difficult to rewrite it as I have privately documented everything I needed to rebuild it.

While that is frustrating, I suppose I needed the practice. Working with an entirely new tech stack that doesn't require much programming, I haven't really touched code since October. Still, hate to lose that code. Legitimately cannot figure out what happened to it.
