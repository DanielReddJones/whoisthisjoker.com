# long time no update

It has been quite a while since I last posted, though there are good reasons. I am no longer working at LeTourneau University. I felt very conflicted about this back in november when I left, but I am enjoying my new position as a Systems Analyst at The Fikes Companies. I am currently working from home and assisting The Fikes companies with their merger with Caseys. Due to confidentiality I cannot talk much about it, but I am enjoying the work regardless.

I haven't been doing much programming lately. Rather, I have been using my spare time to be reading novels and journaling. I feel as though I should be doing programming again, however as it has been a long time. My last major project was Bibliofile in 2023, and writing code is a lot of fun. I felt the need to post here, as I have not posted in months and want to let everyone know I am still alive and plan on doing nerd stuff again soon.

Until next time!
