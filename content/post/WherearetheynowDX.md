# Where Are They now? A new article series

## Introduction, and why I am starting this series

Games, and media in general, are in a rough place. Where did all the good developers go? Why aren't writers trying to make good stories anymore? Why has game design stagnated? There isn't a simple solution to these questions. Oftentimes creatives will go independant, or get laid off, switch jobs, fired, etc.

The purpose of this series is to look at developers, writers, designers, etc. of popular games to see where they are now and what they have made in the decades since their "prime." I am starting off with the Deus Ex development team because Deus Ex is one of my all-time favorite video games due to its philosophical narrative, immersive gameplay(especially for the time), and funny moments. 

Its a masterclass in game design, and the people who worked on it have gone on to work on other projects. I feel like it would be great to highlight these projects, so that people can see "where the good writers have gone" and showcase their lesser known "new works." As Thor from Pirate Software said, ["follow the people, not the studios."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7lLOdwGMdQ)

## writers

Deus Ex had three main writers. Sheldon Pacotti, Chris Todd, and Austin Grossman.

### Sheldon Pacotti

Sheldon Pacotti was the head writer of Deus Ex, and according to [his website](https://sheldonpacotti.com/about) he wrote most of the main script. Some of his works include *Gamma* which is a book with an eerily similar sounding plotline to Deus Ex, *Demiurge* which is a book in which all material reality has been transferred to the digital world, and *Experiments in Belief.* Of these three, *Experiments in Belief* is the only one that is readable for free.

*Experiments in Belief* is a collection of short stories written by Sheldon from 1990 to 2000, and they touch on cyberpunk themes such as dependence on pharmecuiticals, immortality, and similar. Its not all cyberpunk, but I can see why he was hired to write the project. It is free, and I think most of the stories are worth reading.

*Demiurge* is a novel written in 1996, but there was a new edition written in 2000 and another in 2014. I have not read it, but I am going to purchase it and write a review in a few weeks as time allows. From the description, it seems to ask the question "what would life look like if you could copy anything, even physical objects and people, for free? What would that do to society?" It looks like a real brain-scratcher and I can't wait to pick it up and read it for myself. He offers it on Kindle and Nook, but also a copyright-free pdf for about six dollars.

*Gamma* is a book written in 2016, and takes place in a world where a new race of humans, the "transgenic race" are designed by biotech companies. Again, I have not yet read the book but I will be getting it and reviewing it along with *Demiurge.* From the [Summary on his website](https://sheldonpacotti.com/gamma) alone, the book sounds a LOT like Deus Ex. Designer babies with enhanced abilities? Nanotechnology pushing humanity into an advanced but dangerous future? Sounds extremely familiar. I will definitely be picking this one up.


- Games and software

Sheldon wrote a few pieces of software as well. A game called Cell Emergence that uses voxels, Game Blocks which is a game engine for 2d games, and Story Language which is a programming language for writing stories.

Cell Emergence has a free demo to check out. The [full version](https://store.steampowered.com/app/334960/Cell_HD_emergence/) is six dollars. Just like some of his previous work, it deals with themes of nanotechnology.

Game Blocks is free, but it is built for Scratch which I am not a fan of, personally.

Story Language doesn't seem to be accessible. All links, including the ones on his official page, seem to be completely dead. I suppose Sheldon decided against making it public? Or perhaps it was accidentally deleted? This is a shame. I don't see how a programming language would work for storytelling, but it would be interesting to see the attempt.
