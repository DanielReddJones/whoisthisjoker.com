# introduction

AOL, once a giant in both the worlds of Internet service providers and browser software, has been greatly diminished after a series of mistakes they made. Now, they subsist almost exclusively on the vesitges of what remains of their userbase. I have a fascination with this company, scummy though they were, because of how *weird* their software and bisiness practices were. When you got AOL, you got their browser. Until 2005, the browser was for subscribers only until they rebranded their browser as the "desktop browser" and allowed anyone to use it, regardless of ISP. Unfortunately, as of 10/24/2024, the only information on the browser itself is from 2005-onwards. It existed before then, with many different iterations. I hope to document the history of AOL, with at least some degree of accuracy. Because none of the software, besides Gold, is still useable anymore I cannot verify how it worked beyone AOL 8.0, as that was when I started using it at the age of 6.


## 1970s

Thats right, the history of AOL goes beyond the browser. One of AOL's founders, William von Meister, tried selling this software simply called "The Source" in 1978. The idea behind "The Source." *The Source* is described as an "online services company for the general public." In 1978, betting on the general public to use your software was a gamble at best, since it was mostly university nerds, dorks and geeks that used software at all. They also charged exorbitant prices, with a 100 USD subscription. It was sold to *Reader's Digest* because it was unable to sell enough subscriptions to stay in business by itself. It had its fans however. Isaac Asimov clained it was the "beginning of the information age."

According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Source_(online_service)) "*The Source* provided news sources, weather, stock quotations, a shopping service, electronic mail, a chat system, various databases, online text of magazines, and airline schedules. It also had a newsgroup-like facility known as PARTICIPATE." An "all-in-one" place to get all your news, mail, online chat, etc. was repeated with later versions of AOL, so I find it interesting that a lot of those same concepts show up this far back.  

An aside: the founder, William von Meister, was the son of the godson of Kaiser Wilhelm II, the last German emperor and one of the main players in WW1. Not related to anything AOL, but the connection is interesting.

## 1980s

### Gameline

So, "The Source" did not work out as a business. That would not stop William von Meister. In 1983, he formed the "Control Video Corporation" which allowed Atari 2600 games to be downloaded and played via dial-up internet. This service was called [Gameline.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameLine) The goal of Gameline was almost EXACTLY the same as "The Source." According to Wikipedia, "GameLine was originally envisioned to provide not just games, but also news (NewsLine), stock quotes (StockLine), sports reporting and scores (SportLine), electronic mail (MailLine), online banking (BankLine), online forums (OpinionLine), and a wide variety of information including airline schedules, horoscopes, and classified ads (InfoLine)." It had the exact same vision as AOL, but for a MUCH more marketable audience. 

After the video game crash of 1983, Gameline went out of business. Personally, I feel that had the game crash not happened, it might have been successful. Atari was a cheap way to get computers into houses at the time, and it made much more sense to market to that demographic than to the handfull of people using computers in the 1980s. Unfortunately we will never know, because they only reached the videogame portion of their business before going bust.

### Quantum Link

The masterminds behind Control Video Corporation eventually created a new company called "Quantum Computer Services." Their flagship software was "Quantum Link." 

[Quantum Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Link) was effectively "AOL 0.5" Some call it "aol 1.0" but the real AOL 1.0 was called "AOL for DOS." QL was a piece of online software for the commodore 64 that was created in 1985, and allowed people to play games together, get their email, chat, get news, etc. It was the fully-realized version of "The Source" You can see [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnnAuO8DIMM) somehow getting it to work in 2023.
