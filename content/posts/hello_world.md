Hello! I  have moved my blog from Wordpress to Hugo. Some reasons for this is:

 - Hugo is faster.
 - It can run on Github Pages.
 - It costs less than self-hosting a server to run Wordpress on.
 - Hugo is more customizable than Wordpress.

Wordpress required either a subscription, or a server to run. I figured that there was little sense in me hosting it when Github is willing to host for free. As a result, I am moving it. Over the next few days I am going to update this site to add my old blog posts to it. I backed them up before getting rid of my server, so all that is needed is to get them posted here. 

First things first, I need to figure out how this system works. This post is a sort-of test to see if it is working. I know that the blog post list on the front page was having issues, so I will need to work that one out. Will post more later.
